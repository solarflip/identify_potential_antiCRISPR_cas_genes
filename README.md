# Identify potential anti-CRISPR cas genes in viruses
## Overview
Given a set of **archaeal genomes**
1. identify the CRISPR-Cas systems present in each of them (using CRISPRCasTyper)
2. identify viruses which infected the host in the past (via spacers)
3. identify potential anti-CRISPR *cas* genes in those viruses
4. collect additional evidence supporting your prediction of anti-CRISPR *cas* genes in those viruses
